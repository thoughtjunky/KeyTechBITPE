1. Introduction

---------------

The FRUSDR loader utility is used for updating the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit), SDR (Sensor Data Record) of various micro-controllers on a given platform through the use of platform-specific CFG,FRU and SDR files. The FRUSDR Utility communicates with other controllers on the IPMB. This Utility will display the details of the different areas like SDR Area, FRU Area and SMBIOS Area of the Server.

2. Supported Platforms

----------------------

  Intel (R) S1200RP series of platforms.
  Intel (R) S1200RPL series of platforms.
  Intel (R) S1200RPS series of platforms.
  Intel (R) S1200RPO series of platforms.
  Intel (R) S1200RPM series of platforms.



3. Supported Operating Systems

6. Installation and Un-installation (UEFI)

-----------------------------------------

   Installation:

   -------------

   1. Unzip the compressed binary image on any Windows* machine and take the folder copy to any external media.

   2. Connect the external media to the machine

   3. Boot system to UEFI and go to the directory where frusdr.efi is present in the external media

   4. Run frusdr.efi -h for usage.

   Uninstallation:
   ---------------

   1. To uninstall FRUSDR loader utility, manually delete the contents of the directory where the utility is present.
    

7. Usage

--------


   The following is the procedure to execute the FRUSDR loader utility:

      The FRUSDR loader can be run as a command-line application for the actions that it performs, which includes updating the FRU area and the SDR area of the system and displaying the same on the console. The command switches can be given in any order and the utility will function without any error.


		frusdr <switch> [File Name] 


      a. To view the command-line help:


                frusdr /h   


      b. Command Line Syntax:

	Usage:  FRUSDR 		 

        /? or /h              Displays usage information. 		 

        /d {smb,fru,sdr}      Only displays requested area.	

        /cfg filename.cfg     Uses custom CFG file.

	This utility must be run from a system executing WinPE.		 

	Upon completing the programming of the FRU and SDR areas,		 

	the server should be rebooted. For IPMI 1.0 compliant 		 

	systems the SDR repository should be programmed before the 

	FRU areas. IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 systems do not have this		 	

	requirement. For pre-IPMI 1.0 platforms, programming the BMC FRU

	clears the SDR repository, therefore the SDR repository		 	

	must be reprogrammed.		 


Note: In the place of '/', user can use '-' also.


8. Known Issues

---------------
In UEFI, special characters are not allowed for the FRU fields except '-', as the utility might not work with a certain combination of characters. This is due to a limitation from the EFI shell. 
 
In UEFI and WinPE, for customized CFG file update, the tag “@ENVFILE:TYPE:NAME:#?is not supported due to OS limitation.
 
 
9. Instructions to the end user

-----------------------

 1. The user needs to enable the "Plug and Play BMC" setting in the BIOS, in order to enable the MS IPMI driver in winPE. Otherwise the utility will error out.

 2. When the "Plug and Play BMC" setting is disabled in the F2 screen, the user needs to install the Intel IPMI driver manually using the following command. 
	Devicesetup.exe -v install IMBDrv.inf *IMBDRV
    Due to certain limitations from the WinPE OS, MSIPMI driver is shown as detected always, irrespective of the "Plug and Play BMC" status.

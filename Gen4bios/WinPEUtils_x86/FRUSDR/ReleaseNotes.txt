1. Introduction

---------------

The FRUSDR loader utility is used for updating the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit), SDR (Sensor Data Record) of various micro-controllers on a given platform through the use of platform-specific CFG,FRU and SDR files. The FRUSDR Utility communicates with other controllers on the IPMB. This Utility will display the details of the different areas like SDR Area, FRU Area and SMBIOS Area of the Server.

2. Supported Platforms

----------------------

  Intel(R) Server Board S1200 series
  Intel(R) Server Board S1400 series
  Intel(R) Server Board S1600 series
  Intel(R) Server Board S2600 series
  Intel(R) Server Board S4600 series
  Intel(R) Server Board S2400 series


3. Supported Operating Systems

------------------------------

    Microsoft WinPE 2.x/3.x/4.x
    UEFI 2.0/2.1/2.3.1


4. Pre-requisites

-----------------

   1. Boot to the appropriate WinPE (2.x/3.x/4.x) Environment OR UEFI 2.0/2.1/2.3.1.
   
   
5. Installation and Un-installation (WinPE)

-------------------------------------------

   Installation:

   ------------

     1. Copy the compressed ZIP file into your local directory (e.g. C:\FRUSDR).

     2. Unzip the folder.

     3. There will be ReleaseNotes.txt and folders named drivers, win_x86, win_x64.  

     4. Go to drivers folder and you can find a win folder and inside win folder, you will find two folder called "x86" and "x64". Choose appropriate folder depends on the Operating System and run "install.cmd" as administrator to install drivers.

     5. Go to win_x86 or win_x64 folder based on the operating system and you can find 	frusdr.exe,imbapi.dll and msipmi.dll. 

   Uninstallation:

   ---------------

     1. To uninstall FRUSDR loader utility, manually delete the contents of the directory where the utility present.

     2. To uninstall the drivers, please follow this path : drivers->win and choose the x86 or x64 depending on the Operating system and run the uninstall.cmd.

    
6. Installation and Un-installation (UEFI)

-----------------------------------------

   Installation:

   -------------

   1. Unzip the compressed binary image on any Windows* machine and take the folder copy to any external media.

   2. Connect the external media to the machine

   3. Boot system to UEFI and go to the directory where frusdr.efi is present in the external media

   4. Run frusdr.efi -h for usage.

   Uninstallation:
   ---------------

   1. To uninstall FRUSDR loader utility, manually delete the contents of the directory where the utility is present.
    

7. Usage

--------


   The following is the procedure to execute the FRUSDR loader utility:

      The FRUSDR loader can be run as a command-line application for the actions that it performs, which includes updating the FRU area and the SDR area of the system and displaying the same on the console. The command switches can be given in any order and the utility will function without any error.


		frusdr <switch> [File Name] 


      a. To view the command-line help:


                frusdr /h   


      b. Command Line Syntax:

	Usage:  FRUSDR 		 

        /? or /h              Displays usage information. 		 

        /d {smb,fru,sdr}      Only displays requested area.	

        /cfg filename.cfg     Uses custom CFG file.

	This utility must be run from a system executing WinPE.		 

	Upon completing the programming of the FRU and SDR areas,		 

	the server should be rebooted. For IPMI 1.0 compliant 		 

	systems the SDR repository should be programmed before the 

	FRU areas. IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 systems do not have this		 	

	requirement. For pre-IPMI 1.0 platforms, programming the BMC FRU

	clears the SDR repository, therefore the SDR repository		 	

	must be reprogrammed.		 


Note: In the place of '/', user can use '-' also.


8. Known Issues

---------------
In UEFI, special characters are not allowed for the FRU fields except '-', as the utility might not work with a certain combination of characters. This is due to a limitation from the EFI shell. 
 
In UEFI and WinPE, for customized CFG file update, the tag “@ENVFILE:TYPE:NAME:#” is not supported due to OS limitation.
 
In EFI, ENV input is case-sensitive. ENV variable in CFG file and in ENV environment need to match case-sensitively. Upper Case and Lower Case do not match.
 
 
9. Instructions to the end user

-----------------------

 1. The user needs to enable the "Plug and Play BMC" setting in the BIOS, in order to enable the MS IPMI driver in winPE. Otherwise the utility will error out.

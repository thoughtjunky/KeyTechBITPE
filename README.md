# KeyTechBITPE

#Overview
This is my project to automate G6 Computer validation For Key Technology using WinPE 4.0, BurnInTest 7.1, syscfg, and iFlash32 in one bootable flash drive. My goal is to have the ability to update and configure the BIOS and run a 30 minute reliability test and have that test logged. This needs to work on both Gen 4, 5, and 6 systems (not 1-3 since they are no longer supported) and potentially future systems as well.

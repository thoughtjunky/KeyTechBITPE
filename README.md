# KeyTechBITPE
This is my project to automate G6 CPU validation For Key Technology.

This project is the reason I created a GitHub account. I'm just looking for a place to organize my thoughts cause notepad/wordpad isn't cutting it. I'm also trying Notepad++ so I may not even use github that much... we'll see. I intend to work on it alone, as it is designed for specific hardware. I will not be uploading all aspecs of the project, just the portions that modify or work with startnet.cmd

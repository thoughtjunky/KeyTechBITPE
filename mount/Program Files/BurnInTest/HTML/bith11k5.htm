<P>This dialog allows the main window (or its contents) to be saved as an image file which can then be imported into other application or placed on a Web page.</P>

<P><B><I>Image format</I></B></P>

<P>One of 3 different graphics file formats can be selected.</P>

<P>-BMP. Stores the image in Bitmap format. Many applications support Bitmaps but as no compression is used the file size is very large.</P>

<P>-GIF Stores the image in GIF87a format. Fewer applications support GIF’s and only 256 colors can be used. Powerful compression gives small file sizes and it is one of the standard image formats used on the Internet.</P>

<P>-EMF (Enhanced Meta file format). Saves a scalable vector image that can be resized within other applications. File size is very small but only limited support is available in other applications.</P>

<P><B><I>Option – Visible section only (or Save entire window as it appears on the screen)</I></B></P>

<P>If <I>Visible section only</I> is not selected (the default and typical selection), the full results section of the window will be saved, including any part of the results that is currently not displayed in the window (i.e. Result information that you need to scroll down to).</P>

<P>If <I>Visible section only</I> is selected, the full visible Window as it appears on the screen (including menu bar, button bar, border, etc) will be saved. If result data is now visible (i.e. Result information that you need to scroll down to) then this will not be saved.</P>

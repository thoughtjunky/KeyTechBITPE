<P><I>(Applicable to BurnInTest Pro version only)</I></P>

<P><B><I>Select local network card for testing</I></B></P>

<P>This list will show the IP of up to 10 network cards that are installed on the system and plugged in. The values in the fields below are saved for each network card and can be different for each card.</P>

<P><B><I>Test On/Off</I></B></P>

<P>Check this box the enable testing for the selected IP.</P>

<P><B><I>Protocol</I></B></P>

<P>Select the protocol to use for testing the card, TCP, UDP, FTP or Cycle. Cycle will test each protocol for 15 minutes before moving on to the next one.</P>

<P><B><I>Mode</I></B></P>

<P>Full duplex – will send and receive data during the test.</P>

<P>Half duplex – will only send data during the test.</P>

<P><B><I>Transfer</I></B></P>

<P>Max MB - when testing a file is created in memory (or on the disk for FTP) of this size to send over the network.</P>

<P>Random file size - if this is checked then the file created will be a random size up to size specified in Max MB.</P>

<P>Data Validation – if this is checked then the data sent during the test will be validated , this may slow down the testing due to the CPU overhead of validation.</P>

<P><B><I>Log file update interval</I></B></P>

<P>A separate log is kept for each network card being tested and this will be updated approximately by the interval entered here, minimum interval is 10 seconds.</P>

<P>Note: A log file will be produced per IP address per test run for the Advanced Network test. When run from a BurnInTest script, a log file will be produced per IP address per script run.</P>

<P><B><I>Port Number (Data)</I></B></P>

<P>This is the starting port number that is used when sending data during the test, as the testing progresses more then one port may be in use by each network card. Unless it conflicts with other services in use this should be left at the default value.</P>

<P><B><I>Corrupt header threshold</I></B></P>

<P>The “Corrupt header – packet discarded” error can occur often and as such a threshold is used to trigger an error. Each “Corrupt header – packet discarded” event will be logged, but an error will only be generated when this event has occurred more than the threshold number of times.</P>

<P><B><I>Transfer Block Size</I></B></P>

<P>This value is buffer size used when breaking the file into packets and sending it across the network.</P>

<P><B><I>Max Load % on NIC</I></B></P>

<P>This is the required load placed on the network card during testing, the test will be throttled to maintain the necessary amount of data being sent through the network card. For example, a load of 15% for a 1000 megabit (1 gigabit) network card will be a transfer rate around 17 MB/s.</P>

<P><B><I>UDP loss % warning</I></B></P>

<P>During a UDP test if the percentage of lost packets rises above this limit then an error is generated.</P>

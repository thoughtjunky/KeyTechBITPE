<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. The test run stops after 15 minutes, why ?</span><br>
With the trial version the tests will only run for 15 minutes at a time. After the software has been purchased, the time is unlimited. Note that you can still get a much longer test run in the trial version by clicking on the Go button each 15 minutes. After the software has been purchased the test duration can be set from the, ‘Auto Stop’ field in the ‘Test preferences’ window.</p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 0px;"><a name="wear_out"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. How does BurnInTest work? Doesn't it just wear my computer out ?</span><br>
Societies’ reliance on computers means that the cost of hardware failure can be enormous (and embarrassing). BurnInTest thoroughly exercises PC hardware in the shortest period of time so intermittent or hidden problems are found before they turn into a disaster. The typical life span of the main moving component in a PC, the hard drive, is quoted at around 300,000 hours by manufacturers such as Seagate. The use of BurnInTest for a 6 to 12 hour period would thus have a no significant impact on the life of the drive. On the other hand, it would allow manufacturing faults and intermittent faults to be detected in a controlled manner when the consequences of failure are minimal.</p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 0px;"><a name="how_long"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. How long should I run BurnInTest for?</span><br>
Not an easy question. In our opinion, the chances or finding a problem in the first hour are relatively high, (the system gets hot, it's the first run across the disk / CD and the first use of some of the drivers). Then every hour after that, the chance of finding a hardware problem drops significantly. The extra benefit of doing 12 hours compared to 6 hours is thus probably not great. Other nice technique is temperature cycling. All major manufacturers of electronic equipment do this, they have large ovens and fridges in which they test equipment. The expansion and contraction of components and solder joins brings to light many problems. You could do 6 hours On, 6 hours Off, then 6 hours On, to get some limited temperature variation like this. NASA and the Army load their equipment on to vibration machines, but this may be going too far for home / office use.</p>

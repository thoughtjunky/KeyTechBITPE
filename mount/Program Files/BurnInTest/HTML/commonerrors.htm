<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr valign="top"><td align="left">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;">When BurnInTest encounters an error during a test run a short description of the error is displayed in the main window. What follows is an explanation of the common errors that may be encountered.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">No errors</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">No errors have been detected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Incorrect mathematical addition / subtraction / division / multiply</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The execution of a mathematical operation came up with the wrong result (e.g. 1 + 1 = 3). This is a very serious error for a computer as it means the computer is incapable of execution the same sequence of instructions to get the same result. Possible reasons are faulty RAM, System bus, CPU or overheating. There is a strong chance that your computer will crash or lock up just after an error like this because if the computer can’t add two numbers correctly, there is a good chance that it can’t continue to run a program either.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Incorrect MMX addition / subtraction / multiplication</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Incorrect 128bit (SIMD-SSE) floating point addition</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Incorrect 128bit (SIMD-SSE) floating point multiply</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Incorrect 64bit 3DNow! floating point result</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Similar to the above, mathematical faults except that the error occurred while using the extended CPU instructions. (Rather than the standard 32bit Maths)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Failed Windows call - Line Drawing / Bitmaps / Shapes</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The Windows operating system has failed to correctly complete the graphical operation that was requested by BurnInTest. This could indicate that Windows is running low on internal resources or that there is a problem with the software drivers for the video card.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">No free memory for buffer</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Windows does not have enough free memory to allow the allocation of a buffer. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">If the test that displays this error has not started, then this may not be a system error, but rather a warning that there was not enough memory to run the test. For example, the memory test may report this error if there is insufficient available memory to start the memory test, rather than a physical memory error. This may be due to (i) Another BurnInTest test using a lot of memory, e.g. the 2D video memory test with the test all available memory option can use a significant amount of system RAM (depending on the system), or (ii) Another process is using a lot of memory. It is suggested that other applications are closed whilst BurnInTest tests are running, or (iii) there is not enough memory for some other reason.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Not enough free disk space</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">There is not enough free space on the disk to create a test file for the Disk tests.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Test file could not be created</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">BurnInTest was unable to create a file on the disk in order for it to be able to run the disk tests. Check that you have access to the disk with Windows explorer, Check file write and create permissions in the root directory of the disk under test.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while writing to the disk</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The test file could not be completely written to the disk. This could indicate a hardware error or a sudden lack of free disk space</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error writing to disk - Disk is full</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The test file could not be completely written to disk because the selected hard drive is full.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Test file could not be re-opened</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The test file was created successfully, but could not be reopened for verification. This could indicate a hardware error or a resource problem within Windows.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while reading from the disk</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The test file created on the disk can no longer be read. This could indicate a hardware error or a problem within windows.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Data Verify failure</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">This is a serious error that indicates that the data read from the disk is NOT the same as the data that was written to the disk. This could indicate a hardware error.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Disk is full or FAT root file system limit reached</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">A test file could not be created on the disk being tested because the disk is full or the capacity of the file system has been exhausted. Normally this error only happens when the disk is formatted using the old FAT files system. Floppy disks still use the old FAT file system and there is a limited number of files that can be created in the root directory of a floppy disk. The number of files depends on the length of each file name. (and does NOT depend on available disk space). Thus this not really an error, but a limitation of the FAT file system. (Which has now been replaced by FAT32 and NTFS).</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Warning - Disk low speed threshold crossed</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The disk speed has fallen below the low speed threshold as specified in the Disk test preferences window.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not set CD Time format</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not get number of audio tracks</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not play the audio track</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">CD-ROM failed to return status information</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Can not detect audio information on CD</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">No audio media in CD-ROM</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">These errors relate to one of the following problems.<br>
There is not a CD in the first CD-ROM connected to the computer.<br>
The CD in the CD-ROM is not a Music CD.<br>
The CD is already in use by another application.<br>
The CD has an error on it and is unreadable.<br>
The CD is dirty, dusty or scratched and can not be read<br>
The CD Software drivers are not correctly installed.<br>
The CD-ROM has a hardware error.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Checksum failure for optical disk file</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">This indicates that the file read from the optical data disk being tested failed the checksum verification. This means that the optical drive is unable to accurately read data from the optical disk being tested.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not open file on optical disk for reading</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The disk in the optical drive selected could not be opened for reading as a data disk.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while reading file from optical disk</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">A full block of data could not be read from the optical data disk.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while searching for files on optical data disk</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">An error occurred while searching for files on a optical data disk. This can be the result of a corrupted (Error code 1117) or blank optical disk (Error code 21).</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Data read from the optical disk was incorrect</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">A block read from a specialized PassMark Test CD or DVD was incorrect. There was at least one byte in the block that was not the value expected. In the detailed error log there is additional information that give the number of bytes in error and displays the expected value and the value actual read from the disc. It may be that the drive is faulty but you should check that the disc is not scratched, dusty or damaged before assuming a hardware fault.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not determine type of PassMark Test CD/DVD</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">BurnInTest was expecting to find a specialized test CD/DVD in the drive selected. A specialized test CD/DVD has a specific set of files, which all have a specific file size. These disc are normally purchased from PassMark Software or made using the PassMark CD-Maker utility. BurnInTest was not able to find the correct files or the files appear to have the wrong file size. If you don’t have a specialized test CD/DVD available, select one of the other two test options in the preferences window.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error loading DirectX .dll</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;">DirectX (version specified in the System Requirements section) is not installed correctly.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error initializing DirectX</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error initializing DirectX device</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">These errors relate to one of the following problems.<br>
DirectX (version specified in the System Requirements section) or above is not installed correctly.<br>
You need to install the most recent driver for your graphics card.<br>
You’ve selected an incompatible screen resolution and/or color depth for your desktop.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error creating DirectX textures</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Out of video memory</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">This error means that you have exhausted all of your graphic adapters onboard memory.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Warning: Switching to reference rasterizer</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">BurnInTest was unable to initialize a hardware accelerated device and is using software emulation to render the 3D graphics test. This will result in a much lower frame rate.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Video memory corruption</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">One of the pixel values read from video memory is not the same as that which was written to video memory. This may indicate that your video memory is damaged.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error initializing DirectDraw</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">DirectDraw could not be initialized. Check that DirectX (version specified in the System Requirements section) is installed. Check that the most recent version of your video adapter driver is present.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Frame could not be displayed and was skipped</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">DirectDraw reported an error when displaying one of the test patterns to the test window. If you receive many of these errors, reboot and check that the most recent version of your video adapter is present. There are several instances when this message is expected. One example is when the video display mode is changed or power control settings are altered.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Not enough video memory available for test</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The minimum video memory required for the test (usually 100KB) could not be allocated. Check your display adapter is not carrying out any other resource hungry processes, such as games. Attempt a reboot and ensure that the most recent version of your video adapter is present.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Minimum color depth of 16 bits required.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Your screen mode is set to a color depth of less than 16 bits. Set the screen mode to 16 bit or 32 bit color and run the test again.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not find the default printer</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not open the default printer</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not send page to printer</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not open printer spooler</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error writing data to spooler</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">These errors relate to one of the following problems.<br>
There is no printer defined in the Windows setup.<br>
There is no default printer selected.<br>
The default printer is not connected to the printer.<br>
There is no paper / ink / toner in the printer.<br>
There was a communications problem to the printer. e.g. The parallel port may not be functioning correctly.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not open printer command file</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The printer command file specified by the user was not found on the hard disk. Check the path name and file name are correct in the preferences window.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error verifying data in RAM</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The data written to memory is not the same as the information read from memory. This is a very serious error, much like the “Incorrect mathematical…”, error above. It’s highly likely that your computer is about to crash or lock up.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error allocating RAM from Windows</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The Windows operating system was not able to allocate the amount of RAM requested by BurnInTest for the memory test. As the RAM must be allocated in a continuous block, this error can sometimes be seen as a result of free memory fragmentation.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error connecting to network</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not create a network socket</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not set socket timeouts</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">During the establishment of a network connection an error was encountered. The Network address selected has no effect on if these errors occur. They can be the result of the following problems.<br>
– There is no network connection configured for the computer<br>
– The computer is physically disconnected from the network<br>
– The Internet TCP/IP protocol is not installed on this computer</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Networking functions aren't available (ws2_32.dll)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">During the establishment of a network connection an error was encountered. This error indicates that the Windows Network Socket functions supplied by the library ws2_32.dll are not available on this system. This main mean that<br>
- The Internet TCP/IP protocol is not correctly installed on this computer</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not allocate memory for packets</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Windows is low on resources and cannot allocate any more memory.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">These errors relate to one of the following problems.<br>
The Host using the network address selected doesn’t reply to ‘ping’ messages. Try a different host.<br>
There is a configuration problem in your network connection.<br>
Your network card may be faulty.<br>
The network itself is not reliable. The information send was not the same as the information echoed by the remote host.<br>
The network is congested or faulty and the packets are not being echoed within the timeout period specified in the preferences window.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">There may be another device on the network that is interfering with the test. We have had reports of some server software using broadcast messages to check for licensing. This has been seen to cause some timeouts with the standard network test. Try testing on an isolated network.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while setting new COM port configuration</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Windows has reported an error while trying to configure the selected serial port. The most common cause for this error would be the selection of a speed that is not supported by the serial port chips installed in the computer (the UART). Most chips only support speeds up to 115Kbit/s.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Corruption. Data received didn't match data sent</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">BurnInTest has detected that the data received from the serial port doesn’t match the data sent. This could indicate that there is a hardware problem. This type of data corruption would however be a fairly rare type of event. The more common result of a hardware failure would be the total inability to send or receive data. (see below).</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while setting current COM port timeouts</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Windows has reported an error while trying to set the timeout periods for the data transmission and reception. This could be a configuration problem in Windows. This error should not normally been seen.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Error while receiving from the COM port</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">Windows has reported an error while trying to send / receive data through the serial port. If a device (such as a <a href="loopback.htm">loop back plug</a>) is not connected to the serial port then no data can be sent. If the loop back plug is connected and is not faulty, then this error may indicate a hardware fault.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The signal pin test phase of the serial test has failed. This might be because of an incorrectly wired up loop back plug, a cabling problem between the serial socket and the motherboard, a non standard COM port or a problem with the Windows configuration for the COM port. A failure of the CTS pin may be caused by the associated RTS pin, to which it is looped. A failure of the DSR pin may be caused by the associated DTR pin, to which it is looped. If you have made your own serial port loop back plug - check it carefully. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel device driver not initialized</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">To access the Parallel port BurnInTest needs to load a special device driver that allows direct access to the parallel port. If this driver, “DIRECTIO.sys”, can not be found or loaded then this is the error message. You need to be logged in as the administrator in order to load this driver. In Windows Vista &nbsp;(and later) you need to be running with elevated administrator privileges or turn Windows UAC off. This error may also occur if the file is missing.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel device driver could not detect port</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">This error usually occurs if the parallel port test attempts to access a parallel port, which doesn’t exist (such as perhaps LPT3 or LPT4). It can also happen if the BIOS settings for the port are not correct. Note that the old ‘bi-directional’ BIOS mode is not supported. ECP or EPP mode is required.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Could not open parallel device driver</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">This error usually occurs if the parallel port test fails to access a parallel port, which does exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Warning: Could not lock parallel port</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">When the parallel port test initializes, it attempts to lock the port for exclusive access. This is essentially to prevent Windows XP and above “warm polling” the port, which can produce invalid test results. This error results in a failure to lock the port and does not represent a failure in testing the parallel port.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Corruption. Data received didn't match data sent</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The data sent to the Parallel port was not the same as the data received. This may indicate a hardware problem or a missing or faulty loop back connector.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">If a system is under high load, the audio device driver may not be able to output a continuous Sine waveform. If this occurs, you may see the "Corrupt Audio input" warning. To determine if this is load related, reduce system load and re-test. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">If you are testing the video playback at the same time as the Sound loopback test, ensure the video test file does not include an audio track.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">The USB enumeration process failed to find a USB loopback plug device. This might be because, (1) The USB plug is not physically connected. (2) The USB loopback device driver was not successfully installed. (3) The USB plug was connected while a test was already in progress and thus was not recognized. (4) The Windows O/S is not installed correctly. (5) The USB socket on the PC is faulty. (6) The USB cable being used is faulty or is prone to errors. (7) The plug itself has become faulty. (8) The USB cable is too long or of poor quality (shielded cables under 5m are recommended). As there are many possible causes for this error it can take some investigation to find the origin of the fault. The first step however should always be to remove the plug, wait a few seconds then reconnect the plug.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">USB loopback plug identified itself incorrectly</span></p>

<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">A COM port hardware input buffer has overflowed. </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">It is often related to load on the COM port and the CPUs ability to service the COM port interrupts (ie. CPU load and interrupt priorities). The COM port typically has two 16 byte buffers (on a UART/Super IO chip). One for transmit and one for receive. The "COM port detected a Receive Overrun Error" occurs if data is received by the receive buffer when the receive FIFO buffer is full. That is, before a COM port interrupt is serviced by the CPU to copy the receive buffer to RAM. The COM port interrupt trigger level is a Windows setting, this is typically defaulted to 14 - ie. generate a CPU interrupt when 14 of the 16 bytes in the UART buffer are full. In this case the last byte in the UART receive FIFO is overwritten and that data is lost. </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">To investigate further you could try changing: </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">(1) the COM port speed (reduce) </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">(2) the COM port duty cycle (reduce) </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">(3) the UART settings (please see: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://support.Microsoft.com/kb/131016/EN-US/</span> ). For example reduce both buffers to 8 (ensure that the transmit FIFO is not larger than the receive FIFO). </p>
<p style="margin: 7px 0px 7px 48px;">(4) If you are running the optical drive test at the same time, then you should check that the optical drive is on a controller that is set to DMA rather than PIO (as PIO will lead to a large number of CPU interrupts, which will impact the servicing of the COM port interrupt). I understand that the controller can automatically drop from DMA to PIO mode based on the number errors (such as a badly scratched disks).</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">USB errors can be corrected at different layers, including hardware, operating system/device driver and application layers. Errors that are not recovered at a hardware layer are often recovered at a device driver layer (but not always). With BurnInTest and the USB 2.0 Loopback plug, PassMark have intentionally not attempted error recovery at the device driver level as this may mask real hardware problems. This error is a hardware error (such as poor quality USB cabling or other electrical interference) that is not recovered at the USB hardware layer. BurnInTest will try to recover from the error at the application layer to determine if the error is recoverable (i.e. the data has not been removed from or corrupted in the appropriate buffer)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px 48px;">These errors can be ignored by changing the BITErrorClassification.txt file in the BurnInTest directory. In this case BurnInTest will attempt recovery, and only report the error if recovery fails. Note: BurnInTest will not re-send data in order to achieve recovery.</p>

<H1><A NAME="hid_tests_mmx"></A>MMX / SSE / 3DNow! Test</H1>

<P>First some definitions:</P>

<P>MMX = Multimedia Extensions </P>

<P>SSE = Streaming SIMD extensions</P>

<P>SIMD = Single Instruction Multiple Data</P>

<P>3DNow! = The name that chip maker AMD, gave to their new CPU instructions.</P>

<P>MMX, SSE &amp; 3DNow! are all sets of CPU instructions that have been introduced to enable blocks of data to be processed at higher speeds. At the moment only AMD chips support 3DNow! and only Intel chips support SSE. This may change in the future.</P>

<P>MMX allows 64bit Integer mathematical and logical operations. SSE allows 128bit floating point mathematical and logical operations. 3DNow! allows 64bit floating point mathematical and logical operations. </P>

<P>For each test a large array of random numbers are processed using the particular mathematical operations list below.</P>

<P>MMX Addition (64bits)</P>

<P>MMX Subtraction (64bits)</P>

<P>MMX Multiplication (64bits)</P>

<P>SSE Addition (128bits)</P>

<P>SSE Multiplication (128bits)</P>

<P>3DNow! Maths (64bits, floating point addition, multiplication and subtraction)</P>

<P>Each mathematical calculation is performed several times and the results compared to each other. If the results obtained are different from each other then this is flagged as an error. The numbers displayed in the window for this test represent how many millions of calculations have been performed and verified. Each different test is run for half a second. After all tests have been run the cycle count is incremented. The duty cycle and the CPU speed determine how many operations can be processed during the half second period.</P>

<P><I>BurnInTest 64bit version specific: </I></P>

<P>MMX and 3Dnow! have been superseded and are not supported in BurnInTest. The MMX  and 3Dnow! Tests have been removed from the 64bit version of BurnInTest.</P>

<P><I>End 64bit specific</I></P>

<H1><A NAME="hid_tests_graphics"></A>2D Graphics – Graphics functions</H1>

<P>This suite contains a number of tests that exercise the standard Windows graphics functions and the video card.</P>

<P><B><I>Line Drawing</I></B></P>

<P>Lines are drawn into window. The color is changed every 500 lines to enable the lines to been seen in the test window.</P>

<P><B><I>Painting Bitmaps</I></B></P>

<P>A bitmap is painted into a window as quickly as possible.</P>

<P><B><I>Outline shapes</I></B></P>

<P>Two different shapes are drawn into a window</P>

<P>-An ellipse</P>

<P>-A square with rounded corners</P>

<P>The color is changed every 64 shapes to enable the shapes to be seen in the test window.</P>

<P>For each graphical operation the Windows return code is checked to verify that the operation was successful. The numbers displayed at the top of the window for this test represent how many millions of graphical operations have been performed. Each different math’s test is run for half a second. After all 3 tests have been run the cycle count is incremented. The duty cycle, the CPU speed and the video card speed, determine how many operations can be processed during the half second period.</P>

<P>The codes used at the top of the windows are, </P>

<P>LI = Millions of lines drawn</P>

<P>SH = Millions of shapes drawn</P>

<P>RE = Millions of rectangles (Bitmaps) drawn</P>

<P>The total of these three values is displayed in the main window.</P>

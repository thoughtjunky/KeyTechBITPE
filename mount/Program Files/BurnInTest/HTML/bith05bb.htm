<H1><A NAME="hid_tests_3dg"></A>3D Graphics Test</H1>

<P>This test creates and animates a 3D image to test the 3D functions of the video card and its associated software.</P>

<P>The test creates 20 texture-mapped spheres. Each sphere contains 20 ‘slices’ and 20 ‘segments’. Making a total of 16,000 triangular polygons rendered for each scene.</P>

<P>For the 3D test a cycle is defined to be 200 frames of 3D animation. The ‘operations’ count represents the number of polygons displayed.</P>

<P>The test makes use of the Windows DirectX 3D interface. If DirectX (version specified in the System Requirements) is not installed on your PC you will not be able to run this test (in fact you may not even be able to start BurnInTest). DirectX can be downloaded from Microsoft and comes standard with all new versions of Windows. </P>

<P>Some video cards don’t support hardware acceleration at high color depths and you may have to reduce the color depth to 16bit color to get the test to run.</P>

<P><B><I>Warning: A number of manufactures produce video cards have very poor software support for 3D graphics (DirectX). This is especially the case for the cheaper, bottom of the range video cards. Poor drivers can result in strange visual artifacts appearing on the screen, poor 3D performance and system crashes. The old saying of, “you get what you pay for”, seems especially true for video cards.</I></B></P>

<P><B><I>Battery monitoring (via BatteryMon)</I></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/batmonicon48x48.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>BurnInTest can work with another product from PassMark Software called BatteryMon.  BatteryMon allows the charge level in laptop batteries and uninterruptible power supplies UPSs to be monitored. Turning on this feature will cause BurnInTest to log the battery statistics collected by BatteryMon. Both programs need to be active and running for this feature to work. Statistics collected will appear in the HTML, Text and binary log files, where they will be broken down on a per battery basis. There is also a summary charge level displayed in the main window.</P>

<P>For more information about BatteryMon see the PassMark Software web site.</P>

<P><B><I>Temperature monitoring</I></B></P>

<P>PassMark software does not produce a temperature monitoring application, however we do provide support for many third party system monitoring applications currently available. By using BurnInTest with these applications, is it possible to Burn in your hardware while monitoring and logging the temperature of your CPU(s) and/or your motherboard.</P>

<P>In the case of each temperature monitoring application…</P>

<P>-Check that your main board supports temperature monitoring. This can be done from the documentation that comes with the board / computer or from the manufacturers web page.

<UL>
	<LI>Ensure that the third party monitoring application is correctly installed. See below for a list of supported applications.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Check that third party monitoring application supports your motherboard. Each application comes with a list of supported boards. See below for more details on the supported applications.</LI>
</UL>

<P>-Check that the third party monitoring application is a compatible version. See below for a list of compatible versions.</P>

<P>-Run the third party monitoring application, then Run BurnInTest.</P>

<P>-Make sure temperature monitoring is turned on in BurnInTest (from the Test preferences Window) and if required, the temperature source value is selected. For Hmonitor, up to two sources can be selected for display and logging in BurnInTest.</P>

<P>-Start testing.</P>

<P>BurnInTest reads the CPU temperature values from the third party monitoring application, displaying them on the screen and writing them to disk if logging is turned on. Please bear in mind that the accuracy of the temperature values in BurnInTest depend entirely on the third party application in question.</P>

<P><B><I>About Hmonitor</I></B></P>

<P>Versions tested with BurnInTest: 3.1.2.5 and 4.0.1.2</P>

<P>Hmonitor Pro monitors and displays hardware parameters collected by the several sensor chips, installed on certain motherboards. The program can monitor voltages, CPU temperature, Motherboard temperature and cooler fans RPMs. It is fully customizable with alarms that can be set to go off when the temperature goes too high. In addition to this there is a built in "thermo control" function, that kicks in when the CPU is idle. Hmonitor can be used under Windows 95/98 or NT/2000 operating systems on Intel-based personal computers.</P>

<P>Hmonitor is currently available at http://www.hmonitor.com. PassMark also maintains a Web page that can tell you where to get Hmonitor.</P>

<P><B><I>About Intel Active Monitor</I></B></P>

<P>Versions tested with BurnInTest: 1.19</P>

<P>Intel Active Monitor monitors CPU temperatures, motherboard temperatures, voltages and fan speeds. It contains some basic system information and supports programmable alerts. It is compatible with most newer Intel motherboards.</P>

<P>Intel Active Monitor is available from http://www.intel.com</P>

<P><B><I>About MBM (Motherboard Monitor)</I></B></P>

<P>Versions tested with BurnInTest: 5.3.3.0 and 5.5.5.1</P>

<P>MBM monitors CPU temperatures, motherboard temperatures, voltages and fan speeds. It contains some basic system information and supports programmable alerts (also email alerts or application launch on alert), and logging. </P>

<P>MBM is available from http://mbm.livewiredev.com</P>

<P><B><I>About SpeedFan</I></B></P>

<P>Versions tested with BurnInTest: 4.08</P>

<P>SpeedFan monitors CPU temperatures, motherboard temperatures, voltages and fan speeds. It allows the user to alter fan speeds to aid the over clocking enthusiast. It reports system information - in particular SM Bus info and SMART attributes.</P>

<P>SpeedFan is available from http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php</P>

<P><I><U>Standard Test</U></I></P>

<P>The standard memory test allocates RAM from the Windows operating system. BurnInTest then uses the virtual address range supply by Windows. Having RAM allocated in this way means that Windows can swap these RAM pages out to disk and generally move them around in physical memory. As BurnInTest accesses each memory page frequently during a test, this swapping does not happen very much in practice but it does create a small amount of uncertainty about what is actually being tested. Because of the limitations of the Windows virtual address space and fragmentation, only around 1GB of RAM can usually be tested using this method with the 32bit version of BurnInTest. This limitation is removed with the 64bit version of BurnInTest.</P>

<P><I><U>Torture Test (Pro version only)</U></I></P>

<P>The torture test is a multi-process memory test. Multiple processes are started in their own virtual address space and each process allocates and tests a block of RAM. Disk swapping and the over-allocation of RAM can be tested using this method. The number of test processes to start and the percentage of total RAM that each process will use can be specified by the user.</P>

<P><I>BurnInTest 32bit version specific: </I></P>

<P><I><U>Addressing Windows Extensions Test (Pro version only)</U></I></P>

<P>The Addressing Windows Extensions memory test directly allocates physical RAM and locks it down to avoid any inference from Windows. The memory allocated is effectively removed from the Windows operating system and can never be swapped or moved (until unlocked). It is still not possible to use all of the installed RAM, as Windows still needs to run. However this is a much better state of affairs as compared to the standard test. There is also a second advantage with the Advanced test. It can use, in theory, up to 64GB of RAM. The standard version of Windows2000 supports 4GB of RAM. Windows Advanced Server and Windows Data Center Server support 8GB and 64GB respectively.</P>

<P>The disadvantage of the Advanced memory test is two fold. Firstly it can only be used with Windows2000 and XP. Secondly you must manually assign an <A HREF="bith5ddf.htm">additional administrator right</A> to lock pages in RAM.</P>

<P><I>End 32bit specific</I></P>

<P><I><U>Test pattern</U></I></P>

<P>The Test pattern may be selected to be one of the following, or to cycle through each of the above in the above order: </P>

<P>Sequence (0,1,2...255)</P>

<P>Binary 1 (10101010)</P>

<P>Binary 2 (01010101)</P>

<P>Zeros (00000000)</P>

<P>Ones (11111111)</P>

<P><B><I>Log memory allocations</I></B></P>

<P>Turning this option on will cause BurnInTest to log memory allocations (and de-allocations) into the detailed log file. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes. (Not applicable for the Torture test)</P>

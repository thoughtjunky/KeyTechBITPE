<P><U>Network addresses</U></P>

<P>Up to 4 network addresses can be entered for the simultaneous testing of the connection to 4 different locations. These values are used for the Network test. These connections can pass via different network interface cards (NIC) or the same one. The NIC used will depend on the TCP/IP configuration setup in Windows. Each address must be a URL or an IP address.</P>

<P>A URL is the name of a network host, e.g. www.hostname.com</P>

<P>An IP address is a sequence of 4 numbers that correspond to a network host. e.g. 169.192.0.1</P>

<P>If less than 4 addresses need to be tested uncheck the active check box.</P>

<P>The host selected must be accessible from the computer and capable of responding to the ‘ping’ command. See the <A HREF="bith6orv.htm">Network Test</A> for more details. PassMark recommends the selection of a local host to minimize data link problems, which are fairly common on the Internet.</P>

<P><U>Timeout</U></P>

<P>This value determines how long BurnInTest will wait for a data packet to be sent or received before an error is reported. The value is measured in Milliseconds. 2000ms (2 seconds) is the default value.</P>

<P><U>Error handling</U></P>

<P>There are two options for handling errors that occur during the execution of the network test. BurnInTest can either log an error for every bad (or missing) packet or can be set to only log an error when the number of errors exceed a threshold set by the user. This threshold is expressed as the percentage of bad packets compare to the overall number of packets sent.</P>

<P>For more information see the description of the <A HREF="bith6orv.htm">Network Test</A>.</P>

<P><B><I>Edit Options (Advanced Network Test)</I></B></P>

<P>This option is only available in the BurnInTest Pro version. </P>

<P>When the Advanced Network Test option is selected at the top of the Window, the “Edit Options” button will be available. Clicking this button will open the Advanced Network Test Options Window and allow the options for the advanced test to be set.</P>

<P>For more information see the description of the <A HREF="bith6xgz.htm">Advanced Network Test</A>.</P>

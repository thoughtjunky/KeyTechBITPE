<P><I>(Applicable to BurnInTest Pro version only)</I></P>

<P>You can purchase high quality molded loop back plugs from PassMark or you can make your own. A loop back plug is a small connector that plugs into the serial port on your computer in order to loop the data output line into the data input line. It also sets a few control lines to trick the computer into thinking that an external device is connected to the port. You'll find below the instructions for making your own serial port loop back plug. These plugs are designed to be plugged into the small 9 pin serial ports on your computer. In conjunction with software such as BurnInTest they allow the testing of the port.</P>

<P><I>Warning: This is the pin outs of the plug which we have made and successfully tested with our own software on our own PC's. You use this information at your own risk! It's easy to make a mistake and we take no responsibility for the potentially serious consequences.</I></P>

<P>The serial port on IBM compatible PC's conform to the RS232 electrical standard and use a male DB-9 connector. (older PC's may use a DB-25 in which case a converter will be required). The DB-9 connector as the following 9 pins.</P>

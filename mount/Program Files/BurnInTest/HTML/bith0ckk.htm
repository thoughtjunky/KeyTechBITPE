<P><IMG SRC="../images/machineid.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> </P>

<P><B><I>General report information</I></B></P>

<P>The fields in this section allow the entry of information related to the identity of the machine being tested. This can be an aid to users that plan to test numerous machines and need to associate the results obtained with a particular machine at a later date. Users would typically do this in order to maintain an audit trail for quality assurance reasons.</P>

<P>Three free form text fields are available. The information entered into this window will be displayed in saved result files, in the main window and on printed results.</P>

<P><I><U>Machine Type</U></I></P>

<P>Typically the make and model of the machine would be entered in this field, e.g. Dell Dimension T800 XPS</P>

<P><I><U>Serial Number</U></I></P>

<P>Typically the serial number would be entered here, e.g. D345-789-YT99</P>

<P><I><U>Notes</U></I></P>

<P>This is a spare text field that users may make use of to save any additional information that needs to be associated with the machine being tested or the organization doing the testing. No more than 300 characters may be entered into this field.</P>

<P><B><I>Certificate report information</I></B></P>

<P>The fields in this section allow the entry of customer specific information for the system under test. This information is used in the Customer Test Certificate report. See <A HREF="bith76n9.htm">Preparing a Customer Test Certificate</A> for more information about configuring a test certificate for your company.</P>

<P><I><U>Customer Name</U></I></P>

<P>The name of the Customer you are testing the system for.</P>

<P><I><U>Technician’s Name</U></I></P>

<P>The name of the tester.</P>

<P><B><I>Save As Defaults button</I></B></P>

<P>This button will save the contents of these three fields to disk. Each time BurnInTest starts the fields will automatically be reloaded. This can save retyping the same information over and over again.</P>

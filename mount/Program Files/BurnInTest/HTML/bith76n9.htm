<H1><A NAME="hid_testcertificate"></A>Preparing a Customer Test Certificate</H1>

<P>A Test Certificate is a report targeted at your customer. It includes your company details, Technician information, System summary, Result summary and a Certification statement. The report would typically be created after a test run. It is produced by selecting  File -&gt; Save report menu and the Test Certificate option.</P>

<P>The Test Certificate is a HTML template. This HTML template will need to be modified with your company’s details.</P>

<P>The items in the report that are specific to your customer, and likely to change frequently, can be modified from Edit -&gt; <A HREF="bith0ckk.htm">Machine ID &amp; Notes</A>. This is the Customer’s Name and Technician’s name.</P>

<P>The items in the report that are specific to your company, and unlikely to change frequently, can be modified in the HTML template. </P>

<P><B><I>Test certificate HTML template</I></B></P>

<P>The test certificate HTML template must be in the BurnInTest directory and be named BITCertificateTemplate.html. A sample BITCertificateTemplate.html is provided in the installation package.</P>

<P><I><U>Style</U></I></P>

<P>The HTML file defines the Styles for the Report in the &lt;style&gt; block. You can change the style, such as font size and colors by modifying the style block.</P>

<P><I><U>Company Logo</U></I></P>

<P>The first item in the &lt;body&gt; of the HTML file is a &lt;table&gt; containing your company name and logo as a gif file.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<P>&lt;p&gt;Put your company logo here:&lt;/p&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;img src="./Passmark_logo3.gif"&gt;</P>

<P>You should modify the text in the first line to be your Company name, and change the logo gif filename to a file containing your company logo.</P>

<P><I><U>BurnInTest generated report components</U></I></P>

<P>BurnInTest will automatically insert 3 sections where the following marker is placed in the HTML file,</P>

<P>&lt;!--BITCERTIFICATE--&gt;&lt;!--Do not edit this line as it will be replaced by the results report--&gt;</P>

<P>The sections are:</P>

<P>BurnInTest Certificate: Includes Customer name, date, technician name and BurnInTest version.</P>

<P>System summary: Includes summary information about the CPU,OS, RAM, video card and drives.</P>

<P>Result summary: Includes test start and stop times, duration, and a list of tests run with a PASS or FAIL indication.</P>

<P><I><U>Certification statement</U></I></P>

<P>The certification heading and title can be modified in the HTML file by editing the following sections:</P>

<P>&lt;h2&gt;Certification&lt;/h2&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;p&gt;This document certifies that the Tests described above have been carried out by a suitably qualified technician on the System described &lt;/p&gt;</P>

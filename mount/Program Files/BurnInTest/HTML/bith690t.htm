<H1><A NAME="hid_tests_cdrom"></A>CD ROM, CD-RW burn and DVD Test</H1>

<P>Tests the CD-ROM, CD-RW burner and DVD and optionally the sound card (when used with a music CD). This test can be used with many different types of CD / DVD media, including the following types.</P>

<P>-Music CD</P>

<P>-Data CD-ROM</P>

<P>-Data CD-R</P>

<P>-Data CD-RW</P>

<P>-Specialized test CD (see below for details)</P>

<P>-Data DVD-ROM</P>

<P>-Data DVD-R</P>

<P>-Data DVD-RW</P>

<P>-Specialized test DVD (see below for details)</P>

<P>The type of disc being used must be suitable for the test mode set in the CD / DVD preferences window however. If multiple CD / DVD players are installed in your system, you can select all or some of them from the <A HREF="bith5uaz.htm">Preferences window</A>.. Up to twenty drives can be selected for simultaneous testing.</P>

<P><B><I><U>Test modes</U> </I></B></P>

<P><B><I>NO TEST</I></B></P>

<P>Don’t test the drive selected.</P>

<P><B><I>Music CD playback</I></B></P>

<P>For a music CD, the test verifies the operation of the CD ROM and the PC’s sound system by repeatedly playing a music CD. The number of cycles corresponds to the total number of times the entire CD has been played. The number of ‘ops’ corresponds to the number of bytes read from the CD in order to generate the sound. The duty cycle affects the time spent waiting between tracks. Choose a band you like and turn the volume up loud.</P>

<P><B><I>Data CD / DVD read and verify</I></B></P>

<P>For a data CD/DVD, the CD/DVD is scanned with each file being read in turn. A 32bit checksum is created for each file as it is read from the CD/DVD. The CD/DVD is then re-read and the checksums verified to complete the cycle. The best data CD/DVD’s to use are those, which are full and contain a good variety of files. Some large ones and some small ones. If the CD has more than 10,000 files only the 1st 10,000 will be scanned.</P>

<P><B><I>PassMark Test CD / DVD</I></B></P>

<P>This test method is the most advanced CD-ROM test mode and provides a level of in depth testing not available with the other two methods. When possible this method should be selected in preference to the other two. It allows a complete read and verify of the data on the CD, and optionally random seek testing (see Additional seeking and Seek count below).</P>

<P>There is the possibility to create CDs and DVDs especially for use with BurnInTest. These specialized CDs and DVDs contain a set of files that have been specifically created to thoroughly check your drive. With these CDs and DVDs, BurnInTest is able to know the layout and exact content for each file on the CD/DVD. This allows BurnInTest to read back each file and test every bit for accuracy.</P>

<P>PassMark sells these specialized CDs and DVDs but you can also make your own file set using a utility called CD-Maker. You will still need 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party CD or DVD burner software to actually create the disc however.</P>

<P>CD-Maker creates a set of files that can be burned to CD or DVD. More information about this tool can be found on the PassMark Software web site. (http://www.passmark.com/products/cdmaker.htm )</P>

<P><B><I>No CD in Drive </I></B></P>

<P>This test method only attempts to detect the presence of a CD/DVD drive. No attempt is made to read from the drive. This can be a useful option when there are no discs available for testing but a basic check is still required to ensure that the drive was detected and enumerated by Windows. This test option is not as though as the other options and, if possible, one of the other options should be used.</P>

<P><B><I>Burn CD-RW</I></B></P>

<P>This test method provides testing of a CD burner through continuously erasing, burning, verifying then randomly seeking across a CD-RW.</P>

<P>PassMark 650MB or 700MB (user specified) Test CD data (see <I>PassMark Test CD / DVD</I> above) is created temporarily on the hard disk. For the period of the test, the following testing is then repeated:

<UL>
	<LI>Erase the CD-RW media (User specified Quick or Full format). The quick option erases content type information in typically less than two minutes. The Full option additionally erases all user data on the disc, however this can take a considerable amount of time (over 1 hour) and the test cannot be cancelled during this stage.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Burn the PassMark Test CD data to the CD.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A complete read and verify of the data on the CD.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>And optionally random seek testing (see Additional seeking and Seek count below).</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Additional seeking and Seek count</I></B></P>

<P>When <I>Additional seeking</I> is selected (for PassMark CD/DVD’s and Burn CD-RW only), seeking to different positions on the CD/DVD or CD-RW and verifying the data at this position will occur <I>Seek Count</I> number of times for each cycle of a file read and verify.<I><U> </U></I></P>

<P><B><I><U>Display</U></I></B></P>

<P>Depending on the test the following information is displayed in the test window.</P>

<P><B><I>Files scanned</I></B></P>

<P>This is the number of files that have been scanned during the current cycle</P>

<P><B><I>Current file</I></B></P>

<P>This is the name of the file that is currently being scanned. If this is in the seek phase, this will display the file and block within the file that the drive has seeked to.</P>

<P><B><I>Bytes read</I></B></P>

<P>This is the total number of bytes read from the CD</P>

<P><I>CD burn:</I></P>

<P>This is the total number of bytes written or read from the CD (depending on the phase).</P>

<P><B><I>Throughput (Current and Average)</I></B></P>

<P>This is read speed from the CD in Megabytes per second and a conversion to standard CD Drive speed (e.g. 4x). It should be noted that this measurement includes the seek and rotational latency time, so that the speed reported will always be lower than the maximum drive speed. This is especially the case for a CD with many small files. Also most drive manufacturers quote the maximum speed for their drives, the actual transfer rate is usually significantly lower than the quoted maximum. E.g. It is not unusual for a 32x speed drive to only reach a speed of 2MB/Sec, 13x.</P>

<P>This is the write or read speed (depending on the phase).</P>

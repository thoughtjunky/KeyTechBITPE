<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TITLE</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TERMINATION</span></p>
<p>This licence will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions, limitations and obligations described herein. On termination you must destroy all copies of the PassMark package and all other materials downloaded as part of the package.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If you are using a trial version of BurnInTest, then you must uninstall the software after the trial period of thirty (30) days has elapsed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</span></p>
<p>PassMark disclaims any and all warranties express or implied, including any implied warranties as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. You acknowledge and agree that you had full opportunity to test <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> before any live, public or production use, that you assume full responsibility for selecting and using <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> and any files that may created through the use of <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> and that if you use <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> improperly or against instructions you can cause damage to your files, software, data or business. The entire risk as to quality and performance of <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> is borne by you. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of the agreement</span>. Some jurisdictions do allow exclusions of an implied warranty, so this disclaimer may not apply to you and you may have other legal rights that vary by jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In no event shall PassMark, its officers, employees, affiliates, contractors, subsidiaries or parent organizations be liable for any incidental, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever relating to the use of </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">, files created by </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> or your relationship with PassMark. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitation may not apply to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> is not fault-tolerant and is not designed or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which failure of <span style="color: #0000ff;">BurnInTest</span> could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Activities”). PassMark and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>

1. Introduction

---------------

The FRUSDR loader utility is used for updating the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit), SDR (Sensor Data Record) of various micro-controllers on a given platform through the use of platform-specific CFG,FRU and SDR files. The FRUSDR Utility communicates with other controllers on the IPMB. This Utility will display the details of the different areas like SDR Area, FRU Area and SMBIOS Area of the Server.

2. Supported Platforms

----------------------

  Intel(R) Server Board based on Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5-1600/2600/4600 v2 product family

   Uninstallation:
   ---------------

   1. To uninstall FRUSDR loader utility, manually delete the contents of the directory where the utility is present.


7. Usage

--------

   The following is the procedure to execute the FRUSDR loader utility:

      The FRUSDR loader can be run as a command-line application for the actions that it performs, which includes updating the FRU area and the SDR area of the system and displaying the same on the console. The command switches can be given in any order and the utility will function without any error.

        frusdr <switch> [File Name]

      a. To view the command-line help:
        frusdr /h

      b. Command Line Syntax:
        Usage:  FRUSDR
        /? or /h                  Displays usage information.
        /d {smb,fru,sdr}          Only displays requested area.
        /cfg filename.cfg [/nac]  Uses custom CFG file.

      Note:
        When updating with cfg file, SDR data is, by default, automatically
        configured and updated in BMC, which do not need further user
        interactions. You can disable the default mode and use legacy SDR update
        process with the /nac option.
        In the place of '/', user can use '-' also.


8. Known Issues

---------------
In UEFI, special characters are not allowed for the FRU fields except '-', as the utility might not work with a certain combination of characters. This is due to a limitation from the EFI shell.

In UEFI and WinPE, for customized CFG file update, the tag "@ENVFILE:TYPE:NAME:#" is not supported due to OS limitation.

FRUSDR loader utility will only do "Checksum" calculation for "Common Header" of FRU data.


9. Unsupported Features
------------------------

   None.
   

10. Change List
------------------------
   Build 11
   Support one new platform

   Build 10
   Fix a defect about reading FRU with special characters

   Build 9
   Fix a defect about message display

   Build 8
   Add wildcard letter support in *.cfg file
   Change SDR update sequence
   Update supported platforms

   Build 7

11. Instructions to the end user

-----------------------

 1. The user needs to enable the "Plug and Play BMC" setting in the BIOS, in order to enable the MS IPMI driver in winPE. Otherwise the utility will error out.

 2. When the "Plug and Play BMC" setting is disabled in the F2 screen, the user needs to install the Intel IPMI driver manually using the following command.
    Devicesetup.exe -v install IMBDrv.inf *IMBDRV
    Due to certain limitations from the WinPE OS, MSIPMI driver is shown as detected always, irrespective of the "Plug and Play BMC" status.
